# Project COOL

Before the first release of C#, it had the codename **C-like Object-Oriented Language (COOL)**.

# C# 1, February 2002

Included all the important features of a statically typed object-oriented modern language, as you will see throughout *Chapters 2* to *6*.

# C# 1.2, 2003

A few minor improvements, like automatic disposal at the end of `foreach` statements, was released with Visual Studio .NET 2003.

# C# 2, 2005

Enabled strong data typing using generics, to improve code performance and reduce type errors, including the topics listed in *Table 2.1*:

Feature|Chapter|Topic
---|---|---
Nullable value types|6|Making a value type nullable
Generics|6|Making types more reusable with generics

*Table 2.1: Features of C# 2 covered in this book*

# C# 3, 2007

Enabled declarative coding with **Language INtegrated Queries (LINQ)** and related features like anonymous types and lambda expressions, including the topics listed in *Table 2.2*:

Feature|Chapter|Topic
---|---|---
Implicitly typed local variables|2|Inferring the type of a local variable
LINQ|11|All topics in *Chapter 11, Querying and Manipulating Data Using LINQ*

*Table 2.2: Features of C# 3 covered in this book*

# C# 4, 2010

Improved interoperability with dynamic languages like F# and Python, including the topics listed in *Table 2.3*:

Feature|Chapter|Topic
---|---|---
Dynamic types|2|Storing dynamic types
Named/optional arguments|5|Optional parameters and named arguments

*Table 2.3: Features of C# 3 covered in this book*

# C# 5, 2012

Simplified asynchronous operation support by automatically implementing complex state machines while writing what looks like synchronous statements, including the topics listed in *Table 2.4*:

Feature|Chapter|Topic
---|---|---
Simplified asynchronous tasks|2|Understanding `async` and `await`

*Table 2.4: Features of C# 5 covered in this book*

Focused on minor refinements to the language, including the topics listed in *Table 2.5*:

Feature|Chapter|Topic
---|---|---
`static using` imports|2|Simplifying the usage of the console
Interpolated strings|2|Displaying output to the user
Expression-bodied members|5|Defining read-only properties

*Table 2.5: Features of C# 6 covered in this book*

Feature|Chapter|Topic
---|---|---
Binary literals and digit separators|2|Storing whole numbers
Pattern matching|3|Pattern matching with the `if` statement
`out` variables|5|Controlling how parameters are passed
Tuples|5|Combining multiple values with tuples
