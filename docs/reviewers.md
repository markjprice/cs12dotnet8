# Information for Technical Reviewers

If you are a Technical Reviewer for this book, then you will find useful information on this page.

## Installing previews

I expect Microsoft to start releasing official previews of .NET 8 in February 2023.

## Word files

I will add a comment to the top of each Word document for a chapter that specifies the version of .NET 8 preview that I used. You can either use exactly the same version or a newer version but be aware that there may be differences in behavior. This could be temporary (new bugs are sometimes added and later removed) or permanent so it is always useful to add a comment about any unexpected behavior that you experience. 

## Operating systems and code editors

Inevitably there will be differences in .NET on different operating systems. The majority of readers use Visual Studio 2022 on Windows so that is the primary code editor and OS that I use while writing. I often do not test on macOS until final drafts.
